Welcome to my personal DAX repository where I maintain, document, and share reusable DAX code snippets, Calculation Groups, and other Power BI-related logic for Time Intelligence, Custom Periods, and more.

This repository will continuously grow with new DAX solutions I have worked on during various projects.

### 🗂️ Index

#### 1. Time

* 📂 `Custom_Periods_with_Calculation_Groups`
  Contains DAX expressions and documentation for building **Custom Periods** using Calculation Groups, designed to handle various time-based analysis such as:

  * Current Week
  * Last Week
  * Last X Days
  * Current Month
  * Year-to-Date
  * Previous Year comparisons
  * And more...

---

#### 2. More DAX Solutions *(Coming Soon)*

This section will include:

* Dynamic Ranking logic
* Custom Periods using static table
* * DAX for Conditional Formatting
* Optimized Filter expressions
* Other reusable DAX patterns

### 🛠️ How to Use

* Navigate to the relevant folder based on your requirement (e.g., `Time/Custom_Periods_with_Calculation_Groups`).
* Refer to the provided `.dax` files for copy-pasting code into Power BI models.
* Review the accompanying `README.md` for detailed usage instructions.
* Follow best practices for DAX code organization and model maintenance.

### 🚀 Contributions & Updates

This is a personal repository. As I explore and implement more DAX logic in real-world projects, I will:

* Add new organized folders for different DAX topics.
* Include code examples with inline comments.
* Maintain proper version history for easy tracking.
